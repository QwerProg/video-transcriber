[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.320]   hi my name is natalie lynn oh my god beeperoni on the fucking curtain i am back in my hometown
[00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:11.120]   oregon right now with my van spiffy and i'm going to show you how i got these shots
[00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:20.800]   all right let's look at the first one so this was a stop motion thing
[00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.520]   that i did for the intro to one of my borderless series videos
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.480]   at the end of the video it's revealed that it's like a scrapbook like i send this scrapbook to
[00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:40.080]   simon and it's like this like gift to him because of how much the trip impacted me
[00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:46.240]   and so it's almost like the scrapbook is being made as the video plays or like as the experience
[00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:50.960]   happens like all these memories it kind of feels like this is building up into like a bigger story
[00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.040]   but i didn't want anyone to know it was a scrapbook i wanted it to kind of be like the scrapbook is
[00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:00.560]   being created as the video goes on so it's just this really like zoomed in shot of all the
[00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:06.400]   screenshots and little like mementos from the whole canada adventure i did each piece of paper
[00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.280]   individually like the animations i would just screenshot whatever footage i had in my editing
[00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.640]   timeline and print it out and then cut it in the shape that i wanted like i'd kind of animate it
[00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:22.000]   by taking multiple different pictures with it like moving so like every single one of these texts is
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:29.840]   like individually shot pictures and animations i knew that i wanted this van to be like the opening
[00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:35.040]   to the montage that i was editing like i wanted the scrapbook to turn into the video so what i
[00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:41.040]   did is i exported a still of the entire back image of me and simon it was simon's drone shot of us on
[00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.960]   the van i printed out two different pieces of paper of that one paper that's that back image
[00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:52.320]   and then the second paper i just cut out the van right so i could animate that on its own and that
[00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.880]   way when i was editing in final cut pro i could get it to like kind of bounce forward and go into
[00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.520]   the image it's a seamless transition because it's already like there it's like a trick with the eye
[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:09.120]   kind of okay the next shot this was a match cut i did also in one of the intros of borderless
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.520]   i basically just drove my van to like a bunch of different places pulled out my camera pulled
[00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:23.200]   off the side of the road i want to say i maybe counted how many steps i took away from my van
[00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:29.200]   like maybe like 15 20 steps set up my tripod and tried to get it relatively in the middle of the
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:35.200]   frame i think i tried to make sure that my focal length on my lens was like 24 millimeters every
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.840]   time so it didn't look like really wide one minute or like really close the next minute
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:45.360]   the shots actually originally very crooked because it was also like uneven surfaces most of the time
[00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.680]   like when i would back up from the van and go to get the shot and so i had to kind of play around
[00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:55.040]   with it a lot and like recrop the image in my editing timeline yeah you can fix a lot with
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:03.200]   editing the next shot oh god this i don't recommend doing for anyone i really wanted to climb this
[00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:08.400]   bridge called vance creek bridge it's in washington it's been on like my bucket list for a very long
[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:14.400]   time there's a bunch of videographers photographers going to it i didn't realize how like sketchy it
[00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:23.280]   was to climb this bridge until i started doing like research on it it's 378 feet high the second
[00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:29.120]   highest railroad bridge in the us we pull up the day of and we realize like oh my god we're gonna
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:35.280]   have to walk across these like metal planks to get to the actual bridge and if you fall you will die
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:40.720]   a thousand percent i wanted to get a shot of it but i obviously didn't want to have my camera like
[00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:46.800]   vlogging as i'm going across this really sketchy thing so i pulled out my drone and then i flew up
[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:52.560]   my drone in the air and then we needed to start walking across this right but if anything bumped
[00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:57.760]   these then the drone would like run into a tree or something so i had to take these out off the
[00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.960]   controller which was just really sketchy because you know if like i dropped it off the bridge see
[00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:10.080]   they're so easy to drop this is probably one of the sketchiest things if not the sketchiest thing
[00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:16.240]   we've both ever done i feel like drone shots just look cool no matter what and so i try to not like
[00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:22.080]   overuse them unless they're like a big part of the story my friend pointed this out to me actually
[00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:26.480]   he was like damn natalie you kind of use like drones like as if they're like a crane like i kind
[00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:30.240]   of just let it hover in the sky i don't really like to fly it around a bunch because i think it
[00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:37.760]   can be kind of like distracting to the actual story so for this next shot this was like a just
[00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:44.000]   a journal entry but i wanted to make it look cool there's this like lamp thing it's literally like
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:51.200]   10 15 dollars and i just put it up in my window and reflected it off of a mirror the mirror really
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:56.480]   helped the beam shoot exactly down on the spot that i wanted otherwise the whole shot would have
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:03.040]   just been yellow this lighting in the window right here was one of those little like bar lights it's
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:08.240]   ironic because the sunlight lamp looks cooler and was like easier to set up whereas like this was
[00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.800]   supposed to be like professional lighting and maybe i just wasn't using it right but yeah i tried
[00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:18.160]   putting into my window and like tried to get it to come down here i had to show me doing the same
[00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:24.240]   thing every single day for like four months in a span of like three four minutes and so just to
[00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:29.600]   show that i was like i journaled a lot during this for months and then i edited a lot during
[00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:34.720]   this for months and then the keys are right here as if i'm like about to leave because i'm in the
[00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:40.400]   shot i'm writing my last journal entry before i like get on the road and finally like get out
[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:48.800]   of my room and stop editing honestly yeah i have like no knowledge on lighting like i when i film
[00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:54.240]   this video i had no idea what i was doing there's like that saying it's like film the shadow side
[00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:58.080]   of the image put the lighting behind you and that's what i tried to do with this
[00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:03.840]   because lighting directly on an image just kind of looks like you're on like a stage or something
[00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:09.440]   you're like in a play the lighting doesn't really look like super realistic and i kind of took that
[00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:16.560]   from euphoria i don't think i was able to do it at all as well as euphoria but i love how in that
[00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:23.040]   show there's just so many colors everywhere and the images are really like shadowy but just also
[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:28.800]   like really bright and like purple in certain sections and so i kind of tried to do stuff like
[00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:38.400]   that i shot this entire video on the sony a6600 which does not do s log 3 so i was kind of shooting
[00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:42.800]   like i knew pretty much what the image was going to look like from what i was able to see in the
[00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:49.520]   viewfinder whereas now i use an fx 30 and i can get a little more like nitpicky with how i expose
[00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:54.960]   things i yeah i would say i exposed most of these shots by just like my eye from what i was able
[00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:59.200]   to see in the viewfinder yeah just playing around with the lightings a lot in the background there's
[00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:05.120]   a lot of like trial and error oh yeah this one was fun
[00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:14.800]   i just taped my action camera to my fan put it on like the widest angle i could then i
[00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:20.000]   used the sunlight lamp again and i just sat in all these different places in my room in different
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:26.480]   outfits to show like the span of time kind of passing each thing was its own shot i think
[00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:31.360]   there was a total of three different clips and i would just roll like straight through i wouldn't
[00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:36.320]   stop the camera because it was so hard to get up on the ceiling i would just go change in the corner
[00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:40.240]   of my room i had like a pile of clothes like the clothing i wanted to wear to kind of show me
[00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:45.600]   going through the days i filmed this shot i think first show me in the white shirt and then i would
[00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:50.640]   go change and then i'd go in like a black shirt and then i would go change and then whatever i
[00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:56.560]   did that for every single shot all the way around a lot of the scenes in that section are like very
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:03.840]   depressing vibes i was trying to evoke a feeling of like depression so i used a lot of blues more
[00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:08.400]   muted colors i would say and and there's a lot of like shadows it's very like dark most of time
[00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:13.360]   but then i start writing a journal entry that's saying that there's like a bit of hope you know
[00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:18.400]   i kind of wanted to feel like it's early in the morning the sun is rising and i'm about to head
[00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:24.960]   out on the road for the first time in four or five months i i put the sunlight lamp on a warmer shade
[00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:29.280]   to kind of just make it feel a little more like things are looking up from here in the film it's
[00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:35.280]   not just all going to be depressing i like to film conversations from like a bit of a distance
[00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:42.880]   sometimes good morning we slept here last night next to a train the camera sometimes just feels
[00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:47.520]   a little like intrusive to be right there or it like helps you be in the moment more in the
[00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:52.560]   conversation you're having to not just like be directly looking into a camera so yeah we were
[00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:58.880]   like just sitting up on top of the van right here i used my phone for audio this was definitely a
[00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:05.280]   wider angle shot probably like 16 millimeters but it's an aps-c camera so it's actually like
[00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:12.080]   more cropped than 16 millimeters i just wanted as much footage as possible to work with so i got
[00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:18.000]   this shot and then i ran back to the camera zoomed it in and then got back up on the van again we got
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   to this spot pretty late at night initially so we just parked the van wherever but then when we saw
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.160]   like the sunlight come in the next morning we were like oh my god this is a really cool shot
[00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:35.120]   so we reparked the van so it'd be like right in the middle of this thing right here and yeah i
[00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:39.760]   tried to just make sure this whole thing was like centered in the middle of the frame this was
[00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:45.440]   straight up here i use like a grid line on my camera a lot of the times so it's easy to kind
[00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:50.320]   of tell if something is like straight or not or i'll just fix it in post-production if it's crooked
[00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:56.640]   and i don't have time to like set it up all right that is the last one i hope that all made sense
[00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:04.400]   that's how i get my shots
